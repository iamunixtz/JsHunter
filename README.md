- `!status`: Check bot status, including connected guilds.
- `!help`: Detailed command reference.

Example:
```
!scanurl https://example.com/app.js
```

## Detection Capabilities

JS Ninja excels in identifying a broad spectrum of sensitive data through TruffleHog's extensive rule set:

- **API Keys**: AWS access keys, Google API keys, GitHub personal access tokens, Stripe keys.
- **Database Credentials**: Connection strings for MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis.
- **Authentication Tokens**: JWTs, OAuth tokens, Bearer auth headers, session cookies.
- **Private Keys**: RSA/DSA SSH keys, PGP private keys, PEM certificates.
- **Webhooks**: URLs for Slack, Discord, Microsoft Teams, GitHub webhooks.
- **Cloud Credentials**: Azure service principals, GCP service accounts, DigitalOcean tokens.
- **Custom Patterns**: Extendable via TruffleHog's configuration for organization-specific secrets.

Detections are verified where possible (e.g., checking if an API key is active) to enhance reliability.

## Output Format

Outputs are standardized across tools for consistency:

- **Detector Name**: E.g., "AWS_Access_Key".
- **Verification Status**: "Verified" (active), "Unverified", or "Invalid".
- **Line Number**: Exact location in the file for quick remediation.
- **Redacted Value**: E.g., "AKIA****************" to preview without exposure.
- **Raw JSON**: Full metadata including entropy scores and match details.

Example JSON snippet:
```json
{
  "detector": "AWS_Access_Key",
  "verified": true,
  "line": 42,
  "redacted": "AKIA****************",
  "raw": "..."
}
```

## Security Considerations

- **Bot Tokens and Configurations**: Always use environment variables (e.g., via `.env` files) for sensitive data like tokens to avoid accidental commits. Review code for hardcoded credentials before pushing to repositories.
- **Access Control**: Enforce `ALLOWED_USER_IDS` in production to prevent unauthorized scans.
- **File Handling**: All temporary files are deleted post-scan; however, monitor storage in high-volume setups.
- **Rate Limiting**: For public bots, integrate libraries like `ratelimit` to thwart abuse.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Enable detailed logging to track usage and anomalies; integrate with tools like Sentry for error reporting.
- **Permissions**: Ensure bots have minimal privileges in chats/servers.
